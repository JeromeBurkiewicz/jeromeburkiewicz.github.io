<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p align="justify">
Education is the foundation of progress, and teaching gives me the privilege of shaping the next generation of scientists. Since the start of my PhD, I’ve completed more than 600 hours of teaching assistantships as a demonstrator in molecular biology and biostatistics, with one clear goal: effective knowledge and skills transfer. Beyond formal courses, I’ve mentored 11 students (undergraduate and graduate) throughout my PhD. These experiences taught me how to balance autonomy with guidance, adjust objectives, and provide the right level of support for each individual. Working with such a diverse group revealed a crucial truth: every student learns differently, and adaptability is key to fostering growth.

<h1>Outreach</h1>
<p align="justify">
Science belongs to everyone, and I’m passionate about making it accessible. Outreach isn’t just about sharing facts—it’s about building trust, fighting misinformation, and inspiring curiosity.
Since the beginning of my graduate studies, I’ve participated in Researcher Night three times (2021, 2022, 2024), sharing topics ranging from flower evolution to academic life and even the chemistry behind hot peppers and capsaicin.
<p align="justify">
In 2024, I joined the Montreal Botanical Garden’s urban agriculture event, using pollinator specimens to spark conversations about biodiversity in cities. Later, I repeated the experience at the Insectarium of Montreal, where visitors could interact with real pollinator specimens and learn about their role in urban ecosystems.
<p align="justify">
Finally, I wrote my first popular science article for the magazine Quatre Temps (in French), where I summarized two recent research papers highlighting scientists’ concerns about the impact of domestic honeybees on pollination and other pollinators. This experience taught me how to translate complex scientific findings into accessible content for the public.
